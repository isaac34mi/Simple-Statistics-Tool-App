# Simple-Statistics-Tool-App
This is a simple statistics tool that is suitable for importing your data set or creating a new one to find the measure of location, visualize the data, and other features to come.  
My main purpose for creating this tool is to make it easy for students to these simple calculations such as finding the __mean, mode median standard deviation__ , and so on without worring about all the function in excel, and also to learn more about shiny.
I would appreacite any contribution. it been adding more features to it, improving the code, and many among others.
